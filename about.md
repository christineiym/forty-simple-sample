I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina to immigrants from the Philippines. After attending Myers Park High School for a year, I dual-enrolled in Central Piedmont Community College, graduating as valedictorian of Myers Park and receiving an A.S. in Mathematics in 2020. 

While at Central Piedmont, I was blessed to have been introduced to STEM research by my biology professor, Dr. Shuangying Yu. While lacking access to a formal research lab, I learned both biological principles and the skills of resourcefulness and adaptability. The experience also sparked my passion for research, motivating me to expand access to similar opportunities by co-founding Student Researchers
in Science to connect students to STEM research opportunities and mentoring.

This passion followed me into my time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I chose to double major in Computer Science (B.S.) and in Public Health (Nutrition Research and Science).
